            <h1>Walter White</h1>
            <p>Walter Hartwell White Sr., also known by his alias Heisenberg, is a fictional character and the protagonist of the American crime drama television series Breaking Bad, portrayed by Bryan Cranston.

White was a skilled chemist and co-founder of a technology firm before he accepted a buy-out from his partners. While his partners became billionaires, Walter became a frustrated high-school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, barely making ends meet with his family: his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). At the start of the series, the day after his 50th birthday, Walter is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer.</p><br>
